# Setup Your DevicesðŸ“±

<p align=center>
    Setup is essential for Mobile Pen-testing, the tutorial below will be done in Windows OS. ðŸ˜„
</p>
<br></br>

## Emulator
There are many Emulator you can choose, from Nox Player, Genymotion, ldplayer or even using the Android Studio Virtual Devices (AVD). For me Personally I use Genymotion, but of course, you can choose any of them that you see fit for you.
<br></br>

## adb
Android Debug Bridge (adb) is an essential for Mobile Pentesting, as this tool helps you to interact via your terminal with the Android Virtual Devices / your Emulator.

If you already installed an Emulator, it will usually already have the adb in the `tools` directory, but in case you haven't you can follow the installation below.

### **Instalation**

1. Go to https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb or Download it [here](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip)
2. Unzip the Content and move it to `C:/`
3. Go inside the Directory and copy the PATH (`C:\platform-tools_r34.0.0-windows\platform-tools` for me).
4. Edit your devices Environment variables and then add the PATH that you've coppied using `new`
5. Open CMD and see if `adb` is installed by entering `adb -h`

## apktools

As its name said, this is the essential tools to build, decompile, and sign your apps later, you can try to install it by following their guide here https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/.

## zipalign
Zipalign is installed along with the adb folder, if you still can't use it due to file missing or is not included in the adb you installed earlier, you can download the tools from here   
https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-windows-batch-apk-zipalign-tool-v-2-0-23-05-2022.3791644/.

## JADX
JADX is a tool that visualize a source code from Android DEX or .apk file, it helps you to analyse how that application works.

### **Instalation**
1. Download It from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jadx.mirror/)
2. Unzip it and move the .exe file to your work folder.

## Burp Suite
We are going to use Burp Suite the same way we used it in Linux, the only difference is, you are going to use it to catch Request in your Emulator. For this tutorial, I'm going to use Genymotion, the other emulator setup might have a tiny difference.

This Setup will be divided to x phase and will be done in **Windows Environment**.

### **Burp Suite**
1. download [Burp Suite Community Edition](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload)
2. Setup the Burp suite to your liking.

### **Getting Burp Certificate**
1. Go to Proxy and click the Proxy Setting
2. Export the Certificate in DER format
3. Run this command to convert DER to PEM format.
```
openssl x509 -inform DER -in burp.der -out burp.pem
```
4. Then run the following command
```
openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in burp.pem
``` 
5. After that, copy the hash on the top to rename "**burp.pem**" to "**hash.0**"


### **Creating a New Proxy**  
Make sure you have already run the Android Virtual Devices with the emulator of your choice.

Check if the devices can be reach with adb using  

```
adb devices
```

If the Android Virtual Devices can be reach with adb, it'll return an IP and Android Device name, then we'll proceed.

1. Open the Burp Suite
2. Go to Proxy Tab and select Proxy Setting
3. In the proxy tab, select **new** and add your Devices IP and port (I recommend you use 8080, the default)
4. Save it and close the setting.
5. Restart your android devices by relaunch it or via adb command
```
adb reboot
```
6. Open the Wifi setting and choose **"Advance Setting"**
7. Change the Proxy to **"Manual"** then put the IP and Port you added earlier in Burp Suite to the Android Devices
8. Save it and you good to go!
