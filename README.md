# Welcome to Mobile Penetration Testing!  
Mobile pentesting, or mobile penetration testing, is a crucial security practice for identifying vulnerabilities and assessing the security of mobile applications. This process involves simulating attacks on mobile devices and their associated applications to identify security weaknesses and potential exploits.  

As mobile devices and applications become more prevalent in our daily lives, the need for mobile pentesting has increased significantly. It allows security professionals and developers to identify and remediate security issues before they can be exploited by malicious actors.  

In this Github repository, you will find resources and tools to help you get started with mobile pentesting, including best practices, testing methodologies, and popular tools used in the field. By using these resources and conducting your own mobile pentesting, you can help ensure the security and integrity of mobile applications in use today.
